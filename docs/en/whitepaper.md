## Risks & Challenges

### Technical Risks

1. **Unstable AI Generation Quality**: Requires continuous model optimization and Prompt engineering
2. **Blockchain Gas Fee Volatility**: Adopt Layer 2 solutions to reduce risk
3. **Physical Manufacturing Quality Control**: Establish strict quality inspection processes

### Market Risks

1. **Web3 Market Volatility**: Crypto market may affect user purchasing power
2. **Street Culture Changes**: Need to keep up with Meme culture and trend changes
3. **Increased Competition**: Similar platforms may emerge, need to build brand moat

### Operational Risks

1. **Inventory Management**: Print on Demand reduces risk but requires stable supplier relationships
2. **Logistics Timeliness**: On-demand printing may lead to longer delivery cycles
3. **User Education Costs**: Web3 and NFT concepts still require market education

### Compliance Risks

1. **NFT Legal Status**: Different regions have different regulatory policies for NFTs
2. **Cryptocurrency Payment Compliance**: Must comply with regional financial regulations
3. **Intellectual Property**: Copyright ownership of AI-generated content needs clarification

### Risk Mitigation Measures

- Establish legal team to ensure compliant operations
- Adopt conservative financial strategy, maintain sufficient cash flow
- Build community governance mechanisms to decentralize decision-making risks
- Continuous technological innovation to maintain competitive advantage
